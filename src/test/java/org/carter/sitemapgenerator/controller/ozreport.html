<p class="short">Larry around the Green Swamp</p>
<p class="sum">Right up the gut</p>
<p>More and more we have ventured into the Green Swamp where the best 
lift is, dealing with the lack of access roads and landing areas.&nbsp; With the high 
cloud bases that we experienced on Sunday we had more opportunities to head over 
the trees to the inviting cu's.</p><p>Larry, after not getting high southwest of the Seminole glider port, had to run 
south to get over pasture lands on the southeast corner of the Green Swamp.&nbsp; He 
had to skirt the edge of the swamp until he found strong lift that allowed him 
to get under the good cu's east of the first turnpoint at the highway 98 and 471 
intersection.</p><p>Getting over 6,000' at the turnpoint made it possible to head back into the 
swamp to the isolated black bottomed cu to the north.&nbsp; After climbing to 7,700'.&nbsp; Staying high and over the swamp Larry headed to the north northwest to the next 
set of cu's.&nbsp; That is, just two thermals along the west side and he made it 
passed the turnpoint to the north at over 4,000'.</p><p>Climbing to over 5,000' on the western edge of the swamp he jumped across it 
again to the next big cu climbing to over 6,000'.</p><p>Heading east northeast he found the lift that we usually find near the sawmill 
and climbed to 5,900'.&nbsp; Following along highway 50 he suddenly turned south and 
got down to 1,200' AGL.&nbsp;The thermal there got him to 2,700' and that was plenty 
to get back to Quest.&nbsp; with 1,200'.</p><p><a href="http://ozreport.com/pub/images/84T_LarryBunner.igc"><img border="0" src="pub/images/42918larry.JPG" width="646" height="626"></a></p><p><a href="http://ozreport.com/pub/images/84T_LarryBunner.igc">http://ozreport.com/pub/images/84T_LarryBunner.igc</a></p>

<a href="https://www.fai.org/news/189-km-over-triangular-course-chamonix?type=node&id=24536">https://www.fai.org/news/189-km-over-triangular-course-chamonix?type=node&amp;id=24536</a></p>
<p class="BN">FAI has received the declaration of the following World record: 
189 km distance over a triangular course in Chamonix (France) on April 22, 2018.&nbsp; Currently ratified FAI record is 127,1 km made on April 21, 2015, by Laurent 
Faniel, France.&nbsp; We interviewed the new record breaker - pilot Julien Irilli 
(France).&nbsp; Here is the insight into his life and the story of the record-breaking 
attempt:</p><p class="BN">&quot;I've been flying since 1995, I was 16.&nbsp; I started just for the idea to go down 
from mountains, as every alpinist who doesn't like the way down!&nbsp; Flying was the 
logical solution.&nbsp; Every person doing creative things in sport and high level in 
all sports are a big motivation and inspiration for me, I love mastery and going 
fast in the elements of air or mountain!</p><p class="BN">I was in the French National team from 2003 to 2008 and was the winner of the 
French Cup in 2009, did world cup, a lot of cross-country flying, I have a 
background in high-level competition.</p><p class="BN"><img border="0" src="pub/images/julien_irilli_2018_-_189_km_2-1000x750.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p class="short">A bum task call</p>
<p class="sum">A big mistake on my part</p>
<p>On Friday the sky was full of cu's and Larry Bunner took off for a 
flight down highway 33 to Deen Still road and back.&nbsp; I decided not to fly as the 
west wind was supposed to be 16 mph at the top of lift.&nbsp; Larry made it back 
having found consistently good lift on the upwind side of the clouds, unlike the 
previous day.&nbsp; At one point he record the winds at 19 mph.</p>
<p>I wanted to wait until Saturday when the winds were supposed to die down and 
come out of the northwest.&nbsp; When Saturday arrived the surface winds were moderate 
at about 8 mph as forecast.</p>
<p>I called an upwind task before 10 AM assuming that there would be strong lift as 
forecast and a high top of lift.&nbsp; I also assumed that like on Friday we would 
have cu's marking the lift:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pub/images/42818flight.JPG" width="629" height="711" style="width:auto;height:auto;max-width:100%"></p>
<p>In recreational flying I like the idea of going up wind first and later have a 
nice downwind leg back to Quest Air.&nbsp;I made the cylinders large enough to keep 
us over open territory and away from the lake.</p>
<p>At launch time, a little after 1 PM, the sky was mostly blue.&nbsp; I was off first at 
1:30 and pinned off in light lift.&nbsp; Larry was next and found 600 fpm upwind of me 
to 4,600'.&nbsp; I climbed to 4,100' and then headed west with Larry in tow.</p>
<p>For the next fifteen minutes, a few kilometers west, upwind, of Quest we found 
scattered light lift under haze domes staying between 2,600' and 3,200'.&nbsp; Finally 
I found 300 fpm 4 kilometers to the northwest of Quest and climbed to 4,600' 
with Larry circling 2,000' below.</p>
<p>I headed up the course line to the northwest, found nothing, and it seemed like 
the day was not really going to happen.&nbsp; A few haze domes and a headwind did not 
auger well for the day.&nbsp; Larry and Mitch Shipley and Rich Lovelace were behind me 
and not helping at the moment.</p>
<p>Heading back two kilometers I ran into 600 fpm south of Mascotte, south of 
highway 50 and south of the chicken coops.&nbsp; This thermal proved to be very 
popular and Larry and Mitch joined me as well as a lot of the local birds.&nbsp; We 
climbed to 5,200'.&nbsp; The task was officially on.</p>
<p>We spread out and Larry found the next one at 250 fpm back to 4,200'.&nbsp; We were 15 
kilometers from the turnpoint at Cheryl.&nbsp; Three kilometers up the course line we 
found 500+ fpm to over 5,000'.&nbsp; Things were looking very good.</p>
<p>A six kilometer glide against a 10 - 12 mph northwest wind got us to the 
southwest of Center Hill where we found 300+ fpm to 4,400'.&#160; I led out but 
then didn't go back when Mitch called out lift just behind me that he and Larry 
were circling in.&nbsp; I figured that there was more lift ahead.</p>
<p>It was a five kilometer glide before I found the weak (less than 100 fpm) lift 
at 2,600'.&nbsp; I was only two kilometers away from the edge of the turnpoint.&nbsp; Leaving that lift at 3,000' I headed toward the turnpoint and over some 
greenhouses that I thought might be producing some lift.&nbsp; They weren't.</p>
<p>I was soon down to 1,100' AGL 125 meters from the edge of the turnpoint 
cylinder, but I was paying a lot more attention to the possible landing areas 
than whether I would make it to the cylinder.&nbsp; Looking at wires in the fields in 
front of me I decided to turn around and get over friendlier fields just behind 
me.</p>
<p>As soon as I turned around I found weak lift, but given my lack of altitude any 
lift was appreciated.&nbsp; I just hung in it.&nbsp; As I drifted back quickly away from the 
turnpoint, I moved to the north a little bit to capture the better lift than I 
thought I would find in that direction.&#160; My climb rate improved to 190 fpm 
and I climbed to 3,800'.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mitch and Larry were struggling a couple of kilometers to the west 
trying to find lift over a small fire.&nbsp; They were almost as low as I was.</p>
<p>I had been talking with Larry and Mitch on the radio.&nbsp; I said that I was likely 
heading back to Quest.&nbsp; As he wasn't getting up Mitch came in under me and then 
searched around for a thermal.&nbsp; Larry headed north and then found a strong 
thermal.&nbsp; When he got to 5,400' we urged him to continue on the course.</p>
<p>I waited up top for Mitch to climb up.&nbsp; He was in 400 fpm and I was in 100 fpm.&nbsp; Mitch and I got to 4,500' and headed out together back toward Quest.&nbsp; Within 3 
kilometers we found another thermal and climbed to 5,200' We had Quest easily 
made with a 10 mph tailwind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Larry had glided all the way to the ground from 5,400'.&nbsp; He made the 
second turnpoint 5 kilometers south of Lake Panasofkee and then landed without 
hitting any more lift.&nbsp; He later told me that he kept to the west (upwind) of the 
lake but that didn't seem to matter.&nbsp; It appeared that the lake cut off all the 
lift within at least 10 kilometers of it, maybe more.</p>
<p>Mitch and I made it back easily.&nbsp; Mitch went and picked up Larry.</p>
<p>The forecast for Sunday calls for light winds and a high top of lift.&nbsp; Our plan 
is to go around the Green Swamp.</p>

<p class="short">Around the Green Swamp, a day unlike other days</p>
<p class="sum">This is the reason we live here</p>
<p>The forecast was for light winds (north 5 mph) and a high top of 
lift (6,000' - 8,000'), but no cu's due to an inversion and a dry air mass up 
high.&nbsp; None the less I called the clockwise around the Green Swamp task which 
we'd have to do in the blue over large tracts of swamp.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pub/images/42918taskpicture.JPG" width="640" height="549" style="width:auto;height:auto;max-width:100%"></p>
<p>The day was blue but there were signs of cu's off to our southwest as we headed 
down to the south launch area for our 1 PM launch.&nbsp; Maybe we would have cu's 
after all.</p>
<p>Larry was first to get hauled up and I was right behind him.&nbsp; Misael Rosalez, 
Mitch Shipley, Richard Lovelace, and Ricardo Vassmer also launched.&nbsp; There were 
cu's in the sky and some near us.&nbsp; Larry and I climbed to over 4,700' at over 400 
fpm, then moved to a cloud a little to the southwest and climbed to 5,800' 
before heading south.&nbsp; This is the highest we've been right out of the field this 
year.</p>
<p>At that altitude it was easy to glide to the Seminole glider port and join three 
sailplanes that were practicing for the 18 meter event which starts on Monday.&nbsp; The lift was actually broken and weak so we went off to the southwest a few 
kilometers to find more broken and weak lift.&nbsp; There were a number of cu's 
around.</p>
<p>I was higher than Larry so I went two kilometers further southwest over the 
swamp to a forming cu.&nbsp; I called back 500 fpm and my location but Larry couldn't 
spot me.&nbsp; Mitch was a few kilometers further back north of Larry climbing with 
the sailplanes.</p>
<p>Climbing to 6,200' I headed southwest over the swamp tracts not as concerned 
about possible landing areas.&nbsp; Larry had to work around the east and then south 
edge of the swamp as he didn't get up at first.&nbsp; A little later he would find 
strong lift and get high.</p>
<p>There were cu's over the swamp toward the first turnpoint and I just went from 
cu to cu finding good solid cores of lift at 300 to 400 fpm.&nbsp; Misael came in 
under me and later joined up with me as we stayed between 4000' and a little 
over 6,000' under all the cu's.</p>
<p>We were at 6,300' 10 kilometers north northeast of the turnpoint, which is at 
the intersection of highways 98 and 471, right on the course line.&nbsp; It was all 
blue going to the turnpoint from where we were and it looked blue after that 
also.</p>
<p>We headed in that direction but then had to veer to the southeast of the 
turnpoint to get under some clouds to get back up as we were down to 2,600'.</p>
<p>Larry and Mitch were just to our east and hadn't made it to the turnpoint yet, 
but were much higher.&nbsp; We turned in broken lift averaging 300 fpm.&nbsp; The thermals 
were going up for about half your circle.&nbsp; Mitch and Larry we reporting much 
stronger lift and continued to do so.</p>
<p>Climbing to 5,800' I headed north&#160;back into the swamp toward a fat cu.&nbsp; The 
landing areas were limited so it was good to hear as I approached it that Larry 
was high in it.&#160; Again the lift was spotty, broken and weak.&nbsp; Larry zoomed 
up to 7,500', but I had to work to finally get to 7,200'.&#160; I had pushed up 
wind to the next cu and found 400 fpm to get to that final altitude.</p>
<p>Larry had headed straight north northeast along the course line over the Green 
Swamp ignoring the pasture lands further west.&nbsp; I started that way but looking 
ahead I felt that the clouds were better to the west a bit with sunlit ground 
underneath them.&nbsp; I headed northwest to find lift on the upwind sides of the 
cu's.</p>
<p>I averaged 300 - 400 fpm in the thermals, but they continued to be only half 
thermals, with surges and half sink.&nbsp; No matter how tight I circled I could not 
get solid cores.&nbsp; As I was hearing stories of 600 fpm from Larry and Mitch, I was 
not as happy as I might have been.&nbsp; I climbed to 6,500' a few kilometers from the 
second turnpoint.&nbsp; Larry and Mitch were far ahead.</p>
<p>There were strong looking cu's at the turnpoint, with dark bottoms and sunshine 
on dry fields just to the west.&nbsp; Still the lift I found was weak.&nbsp; 200 - 300 fpm.&nbsp; Misael joined me but then got way low.&nbsp; I didn't see where he went.</p>
<p>I worked to the north to get under the cu's north of the Green Swamp.&nbsp; Working 
200 - 300 fpm I finally got under a big dark cu over the Green Swamp, but again 
the lift was poor, 290 fpm.&nbsp; On many days this amount of lift would have been 
great, but the day promised so much more and I was getting further and further 
behind.&nbsp; I climbed to 6,400' and headed for the cu's by the sawmill on highway 50 
at the north end of the Green Swamp.</p>
<p>There was a long bank of cu's stretching to the southeast and northwest.&nbsp; I was 
in the middle of the line.&nbsp; I started at 100 fpm, then searched around to the 
southeast and finding nothing came back and searched some more before I found 
240 fpm.&nbsp; Broken as always.</p>
<p>Climbing to 5,300' I could see that there was a big blue hole between me and 
Quest.&nbsp; So I headed northeast to get under the blackest cloud in the neighborhood 
and climbed to 6,100' over highway 50.&nbsp; The 6030 said I had goal made.&nbsp; I didn't 
believe it.&nbsp; I could see more cu's along the highway so I headed in that 
direction to the east instead of toward Quest.</p>
<p>I fell like at rock averaging 400 fpm down for over 8 kilometers, finding lift 
in the blue at the western edge of the nursery and climbing from 3,000' to 
3,600' before it disappeared.</p>
<p>There was another bank of cu's ahead and I headed for them.&nbsp; Now I was falling 
even faster than before.&nbsp; Down to 2,200' just west of Mascotte and under the 
cu's, I turned to the north to see if there was some lift under the northern 
part of this cu near the chicken coops.&nbsp; Down to 1,400' AGL I finally felt the 
lift.</p>
<p>Finally a thermal that was going up all the way around.&nbsp; It got stronger and 
stronger getting up to 700 fpm.&nbsp; Very quickly I had way more altitude than I 
needed to get to Quest.&nbsp; It was by far the best thermal of the day for me.</p>
<p>Mitch got there before me, of course, and finding 900 fpm decided to also try to 
go to Wallaby and back.&nbsp; Don't know if he made it.&nbsp; Larry had been there for a 
while.&nbsp; Richard and I think Misael also made it before I got there.</p>
